# RISC-V Pipeline + Cache Simulator

**Mini cycle-accurate CPU simulator in C++ demonstrating pipeline execution, cache behavior, and performance metrics.**  
Showcases how memory access patterns affect CPI, cache hit/miss rates, and pipeline efficiency â€” directly relevant to embedded systems and VLSI software engineering.

## Why This Project Matters

- Models a **5-stage instruction pipeline** (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB) with cache simulation.  
- Calculates **CPI, stalls, cache hits/misses**, providing real insight into CPU performance.  
- Demonstrates **software-level modeling of hardware**, bridging CSE algorithms and VLSI/embedded design.  
- Easily extensible for:
  - Branch prediction and misprediction penalties
  - Different cache sizes, associativities, replacement policies
  - Large trace files for performance testing
- Perfect example to discuss **memory optimization, performance bottlenecks, and low-level system design** in interviews.
